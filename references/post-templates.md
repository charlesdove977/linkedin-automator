# Post Templates

Proven LinkedIn post structures for engagement and authority.

## Template 1: Listicle ("X Things I Stopped Doing")

### Structure
```
[Credibility hook] + [Number] things I stopped doing [as role/in context]:

1. [Old behavior]
→ Now I [new behavior]
[1-2 sentences on why/result]

2. [Old behavior]
→ Now I [new behavior]
[1-2 sentences on why/result]

[Repeat for each item...]

The shift? [Reframe the overall change in one line]

[Question for engagement]
```

### Example
```
After 12 years building businesses, here are 5 things I stopped doing:

1. Saying yes to every opportunity
→ Now I filter ruthlessly against my ICP
Revenue went up. Stress went down.

2. Building before validating
→ Now I sell first, build second
No more wasted months on ideas nobody wants.

3. Hiring for skills alone
→ Now I hire for alignment first
Wrong culture fit costs 10x more than training.

4. Checking email first thing
→ Now I protect my first 2 hours
Deep work before shallow work. Always.

5. Trying to be everywhere online
→ Now I own one platform before expanding
LinkedIn only until it's dialed.

The shift? I stopped optimizing for busy. Started optimizing for leverage.

What's one thing you stopped doing that changed everything?
```

### Hooks That Work
- "After X years doing [thing]..."
- "Here's what changed when I stopped..."
- "Unpopular opinion: stop doing [common thing]..."
- "The [role] playbook is broken. Here's what actually works..."

## Template 2: Story Post

### Structure
```
[Attention-grabbing opening line]

[Set the scene — 1-2 sentences on context]

[The problem/challenge — what went wrong or what you faced]

[The turning point — what changed or what you did]

[The result — what happened]

[The lesson — what you learned]

[Question for engagement]
```

### Example
```
I almost quit my agency last year.

We had 15 clients. Revenue was great on paper. But I was working 70-hour weeks and hating every second.

Then I fired our biggest client.

They were 30% of revenue but 80% of our problems. Scope creep. Late nights. Endless revisions.

Within 3 months:
- Replaced the revenue with 2 better clients
- Cut my hours to 40/week
- Actually enjoyed the work again

The lesson? Revenue isn't profit if it costs you your sanity.

Have you ever fired a client and been glad you did?
```

### Hooks That Work
- "I almost [dramatic action] last [timeframe]."
- "The worst day of my business taught me..."
- "Nobody talks about the time I..."
- "Here's what actually happened when..."

## Template 3: Value Bomb

### Structure
```
[Bold claim or counterintuitive hook]

Here's how [to achieve thing / why this works]:

[Step/Point 1]

[Step/Point 2]

[Step/Point 3]

That's it. [Reinforcing statement]

[Question or CTA]
```

### Example
```
You don't need more leads. You need better qualification.

Here's my 3-question filter before any sales call:

1. "What's the cost of not solving this?"
If they can't quantify pain, they won't pay to fix it.

2. "What have you already tried?"
No previous attempts = not serious yet.

3. "What's your timeline?"
"Someday" means never. Need urgency.

That's it. Three questions. Cuts my no-shows by 60%.

What's your qualification filter?
```

### Hooks That Work
- "Stop [common advice]. Do this instead."
- "The [thing] nobody talks about..."
- "Here's the exact [process/script/framework] I use..."
- "Unpopular take: [counterintuitive statement]"

---

## Template 4: Engagement Post

### Structure
```
[Provocative question or statement]

[Your brief take — 1-2 sentences]

[Acknowledge other perspectives exist]

[Genuine question to spark discussion]
```

### Example
```
Hot take: Cold email is dead for agencies.

We stopped cold outreach 6 months ago. Referrals and content only.

Revenue went up 40%.

Maybe it still works for some. But I think the game has changed.

Am I wrong? What's working for you right now?
```

### Hooks That Work
- "Controversial opinion..."
- "I'll probably get hate for this, but..."
- "The data says one thing. My experience says another."
- "Genuinely curious — [question]?"

---

## Template 5: Behind the Scenes

### Structure
```
[What you're working on]

[Why it matters / what you're trying to solve]

[Your current approach or thinking]

[Question to involve audience]
```

### Example
```
Building something new this week.

An AI-powered intake system for law firms. The problem: lawyers hate forms, but they need data to qualify leads.

The approach: Conversational AI that feels like talking to a helpful assistant, not filling out paperwork.

Early tests show 3x completion rates vs. standard forms.

What would you want in a lead intake experience?
```

### Hooks That Work
- "Here's what I'm building this week..."
- "Sneak peek at something we're testing..."
- "Behind the scenes of our latest project..."
- "Working through a problem — help me think..."
