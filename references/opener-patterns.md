# Opener Patterns

Templates and examples for first-touch DM messages.

## Core Principles

1. **2-3 sentences max** - Respect their time
2. **Reference something specific** - Show you looked at their profile
3. **End with open question** - Invite response
4. **Never pitch** - First message is about them, not you
5. **Match user's tone** - Use voice settings from config.md

❌ "I noticed you might benefit from our services..."

### Don't: Be Generic
❌ "Hey, great to connect!"
❌ "Love your profile!"
❌ "Saw we have mutual connections"

### Don't: Make It About You

❌ "I've helped 100+ people like you..."

### Don't: Use Obvious Templates
❌ "I came across your profile and was impressed..."

### Don't: Ask for Too Much
