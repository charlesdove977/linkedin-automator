# DM Guidelines

Rules and patterns for replying to LinkedIn messages.

## Core Response Principles

1. **Acknowledge specifically** - Reference what they said, not generic "thanks"
2. **Share something** - Add value, perspective, or personal experience
3. **End with question** - Keep the conversation going
4. **Match energy** - If they're casual, be casual. If formal, be formal.
5. **Soft booking** - Only mention calls when they show pain or interest

## Conversation Classification

### First Response
They replied to your initial outreach.

**Goal:** Build on the thread you started
**Tone:** Warm, grateful they engaged
**Strategy:** Go deeper on the topic you opened with

**Template:**
```
Hey [Name] — [acknowledge their reply specifically]. [Share related thought/experience]. [Follow-up question that builds on thread]?
```

---

### Ongoing Conversation
Multiple exchanges back and forth.

**Goal:** Deepen relationship, find mutual value
**Tone:** Comfortable, like talking to a peer
**Strategy:** Look for opportunities to help or connect

**Template:**
```
[React to what they shared]. [Add your perspective or experience]. [Question to continue or pivot to new topic]?
```

---

### Booking Request
They've shown interest in a call/meeting.

**Goal:** Make it easy to schedule
**Tone:** Enthusiastic but not salesy
**Strategy:** Provide booking link, keep door open

**Template:**
```
[Express genuine interest]. Here's my calendar: [booking_link]. [Open question about their preferences or what they want to cover]?
```

### Cold Pitch to Us
Someone selling to you.

**Options:**
1. **Ignore/Mark read** - Most common, no response needed
2. **Polite decline** - If they seem genuine or persistent
3. **Engage** - If actually interesting or useful

**Polite Decline Template:**
```
Appreciate you reaching out! Not a fit for me right now, but best of luck with [their thing].
```

---

### Stale Conversation
No reply from them in 14+ days.

**Options:**
1. **Archive** - Move to completed in tracking
2. **One more try** - Send a light follow-up

**Follow-up Template:**
```
Hey [Name] — just circling back on this. No worries if you're slammed. Would love to continue the convo when timing's better.
```

## Response Components

### Acknowledgment Phrases
- "That's interesting that..."
- "Makes sense about..."
- "I can relate to the [X] part..."
- "Sounds like you've figured out..."
- "[Topic] is something I've been thinking about too..."

### Value-Add Phrases
- "One thing that's worked for me..."
- "I've seen others handle that by..."
- "Have you tried [specific suggestion]?"
- "Reminds me of when I..."
- "That connects to something I read recently about..."

### Soft Booking Phrases (When Appropriate)
- "Happy to jam on this more if useful—"
- "If you want to go deeper, I'm around—"
- "Would be fun to riff on this properly—"

### Question Types
- **Clarifying:** "What do you mean by [X]?"
- **Expanding:** "How did you handle [related thing]?"
- **Pivoting:** "Curious—how does that connect to [new topic]?"
- **Personal:** "What got you interested in [thing]?"

## Pain Point Detection

Look for signals that they're struggling with something:

| Signal | Response Approach |
|--------|------------------|
| "struggling with..." | Validate, share similar experience, offer perspective |
| "can't figure out..." | Ask clarifying questions, offer to help |
| "frustrated by..." | Empathize, share if you've solved similar |
| "need to..." | Explore the need, see if you can help |
| "wish I could..." | Understand the desire, connect to solutions |

When pain is clear and relevant to what you do:
```
[Acknowledge the pain]. I've worked through similar with [context]. Happy to share what worked if helpful—[booking_link]?
```

---

## Tone Calibration

### Match Their Energy

**If they're casual:**
> "haha yeah totally — that's been my experience too"

**If they're formal:**
> "I appreciate you sharing that perspective. It aligns with what I've observed as well."

**If they're brief:**
> Keep your response similarly concise

**If they're detailed:**
> Match with substantive response

### Use Configured Voice

Pull from user's config.md:
- Key phrases they use
- Words/styles they avoid
- Their sample message as reference

## Anti-Patterns

### Don't: Give Generic Acknowledgment
❌ "Thanks for sharing!"
❌ "Great point!"
❌ "Love it!"

### Don't: Make Every Response About You
❌ "That reminds me of my business..."
❌ "We actually solve that exact problem..."

### Don't: Push for Calls Too Early
❌ "We should definitely hop on a call"
❌ "When are you free this week?"

### Don't: Let Threads Die
❌ "Cool, let me know!" (no question)
❌ "Makes sense." (dead end)

### Don't: Over-Respond
❌ Writing paragraphs when they sent 2 sentences
❌ Asking 5 questions at once
